3/11/2020: We found a strange pattern in the weight-at-age matrix. 
This results in a drop of the SSB in 2010 in the assessment.
We don't believe this is real. It is caused by the corrections 
in the weight-at-age done by Vanja in July to correct the SOPs in years
2005, 2010 and 2011. We have checked some data with Andres and there is no 
reason supporting lower weights-at-age in 2010. There might be some problem
in the raising of the numbers at age, but this requires further exploration
and we cannot do it now. So, we decided to "undo" the data correction done in
July, we keep the previous weight-at-age that do not show any pattern and we 
simply correct the number-at-age by the the SOPs.
